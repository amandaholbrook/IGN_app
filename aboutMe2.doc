My name is Amanda Holbrook and I am a senior in Computer Science at Ohio University 
in Athens, Ohio, however I will be taking a fifth year. In addition to my relevant 
experience and academic background, I am also very interested in a company with more 
of a creative outlet, specifically working with video games, and I feel that my 
knowledge and passion in that would be a good fit for IGN. I am familiar with a wide 
variety of programming languages, including C++, Python, Java, and Node.js. I have 
experience working mostly independently as the sole programmer in a Bioinformatics 
Research Lab where I am simply given instructions on specifics to create a program 
that can take large amounts of data, organize, analyze, and reformat it. I also have 
experience working in a team with both new and ongoing projects like various web 
applications within Ohio Universityâ€™s Information Technology Department. In both of 
these opportunities I had to learn several new language, and so my ability to do so 
quickly and efficiently has be greatly improved. The emphasis on group projects at 
Ohio University helped strengthen my communication, interpersonal, and leadership 
skills. I gained better understanding of various languages and tools by helping 
former classmates understand them. The courses at Ohio University are structured so 
that you are programming from the very first course to the very last, so I have been 
able to cultivate my technical skills since day one. I have also spent a lot of time 
learning how to effectively take basic instructions for a program and turn them into 
a detailed, well thought-out end product, keeping in mind any feature the program may 
need.

I look forward to the opportunity to tell you about my interest in joining the programming 
team at IGN. Thank you for your time and consideration.
