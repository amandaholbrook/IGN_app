Team Rocket is at it again! This time they are looking to terrorize the city of San Francisco, and aim to make the 
trek through the “crookedest street in the world” ( Lombard Street ) to steal a treasure contained in Coit Tower. 
Legend has it, the tower is completely filled with Poké Balls, enough Poké Balls for Team Rocket to amass an army of 
Pokémon! Fortunately, a slumbering Pokémon is known to sleep at the bottom of Lombard St and block the entrance to 
Coit Tower entirely. If Team Rocket determines how to wake the sleeping giant and successfully steals the cache of 
Poké Balls that fills Coit Tower, about how many Poké Balls would they walk away with? Describe each step in your 
thought process.


My approach to this would be to simply find the dimensions of Coit Tower and of a pokeball, and then calculate how 
many pokeballs could fit into the tower.

I did some googling to find the various measurements.

Tower Height: 210 ft
Base(Solid) Height: 26 ft
Height for Volume: 184 ft - 2208 in
Tower Radius: 42 ft - 504 in
(Width not listed anywhere, so I based it on the ratio I got from scaled pictures, which showed that the height was 
about 2.5x the width.)
Tower Volume: 1,760,000,000 in^3

Pokeball Radius: 1.25 in
Pokeball Volume: 8.18 in^3

Here I would probably pretend the pokeballs are actually cylinders, since that it the shape of the building and so 
that it the amount of space they would take up.

Pokeball Radius: 1.25 in
Pokeball Height: 2.50 in
Pokeball Cylinder Volume: 12.27 in^3

Now just divide the tower volume by the pokeball volume to see how may will fit.

1,760,000,000 in^3 / 12.27 in^3
 = 143,439,282.804

So about 143,439,282 pokeballs would fit inside the tower.
That's a pretty big army for Team Rocket!
