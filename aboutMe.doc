My name is Amanda Holbrook, and I am a Computer Science major at Ohio University. 
I have followed IGN for a long time, mainly for news about gaming. I have been 
playing games for as long as I can remember, first on old nintendo systems, then 
to playstation, and then to pc. My parents stopped buying us video games, so I 
switched to using my moms laptop for games. Then, as soon as I had saved enough 
from my first job, I bought myself a desktop. Currently, I am in school learning 
how to code, and my goal is to learn how to make video games.
