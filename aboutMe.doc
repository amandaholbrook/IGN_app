My name is Amanda Holbrook, and I am a Computer Science major at Ohio University. 
I have followed IGN for a long time, mainly for news about gaming. 
I have been playing games for as long as I can remember, first on old nintendo systems, then to playstation, and then to pc. 
My parents stopped buying us video games, so I switched to using my moms laptop for games. 
Then, as soon as I had saved enough from my first job, I bought myself a desktop. 
Currently, I am in school learning how to code, and my goal is to learn how to make video games.
